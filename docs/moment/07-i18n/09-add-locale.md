title: Add your locale
---


To add your locale to FrozenMoment, submit a pull request with both a locale file and a test file. You can find examples in `frozen-moment/locale/fr.js` and `frozen-moment/test/locale/fr.js`.

To run the tests in Node.js, do `npm install`, then `grunt`.

If all the tests pass, submit a pull request.  Thank you for contributing!
