title: Where to use it
---


FrozenMoment was designed to work both in the browser and in Node.js.

We don't have a CI system set up for this fork yet.  When we do, we'll probably
replicate the browser portfolio used for upstream testing: IE 8, IE 9 on
Windows 7, stable Chrome on Windows XP, Safari 10.8 on Mac, and stable
Firefox on Linux.

All code should work in both environments (browser and Node.js). Note that this
fork is a new project under heavy initial development and things will be a bit
rough around the edges. All unit tests will be run in both environments once we
have a CI system in place.
