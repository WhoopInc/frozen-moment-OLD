A lightweight javascript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.

This is a recent fork of [Moment.js](https://github.com/moment/moment).  Whereas Moment provides a mutable wrapper over the native JavaScript Date API, this project seeks to provide an immutable API for working with moments in time that can be created with a chainable builder API.  We aim to maintain general feature parity with the upstream Moment API.

## [Documentation](https://github.com/WhoopInc/frozen-moment/tree/docs/docs/moment)

Sorry this documentation is so clunky to navigate right now.  We haven't had a chance to generate and publish a proper website from these Markdown files yet.  We have tried to update the documentation content to account for our API changes, though, so please open an issue (or a pull request!) if you notice anything that doesn't match the actual behavior of the frozen-moment.js code.
